    "\n",
    "* To represent a review to a neural network, each word has to be expressed as a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each word in the review corpus is assigned a unique number. Assume the total number of unique words is feature_count. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each review can then be represented as a vector of length feature_count. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Entries in this vector can be either 0 or 1, if the word is present in this review or absent respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A more advanced approach will replace the binary numbers above with ratios that emphaise how rare ( and hence meanigful and representative ) the word is across all reviews. For example, a word like \"product\" will have little use for the neural network in determing whetehr this is a rating-1 or rating-5 review, as this particular word occurs in most reviews, both positive and negative ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Here we limit the number of feature_count to 40,000 to cut down the training time. \n",
